description: >
  FedRAMP Moderate baseline applies to cloud service offerings (CSOs) processing, storing,
  or transmitting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). It maps to NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5
  and requires 325 controls across 17 control families. This template focuses on the
  high-priority control families most relevant to AI platform deployments.

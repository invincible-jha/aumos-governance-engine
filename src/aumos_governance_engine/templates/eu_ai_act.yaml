full_name: "Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 — Artificial Intelligence Act"
issuing_body: "European Parliament and Council"
description: >
  The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive horizontal regulation on artificial
  intelligence. It classifies AI systems by risk level (unacceptable, high, limited,
  minimal) and imposes proportionate requirements. This template focuses on obligations
  for high-risk AI systems under Annex III, which include AI used in employment,
  credit, law enforcement, education, and biometric identification.
